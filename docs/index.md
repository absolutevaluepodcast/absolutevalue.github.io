### Russell Bogue - Decision-making, Data Privacy, and Positivity Inertia

Today, I'm very excited to welcome Russell Bogue, an old friend of mine, who's currently a JD candidate at Yale Law School. Russell is one of the most mature and thoughtful individuals I know. And it was awesome to catch up on with him while discussing everything from trends in data privacy, to the key principles that we believe should guide decision-making and productivity. We hope you enjoy, and thanks for listening.
